# Overview
**Underwater exploration, system’s management and maintenance, and research. At the tip of your fingertips.**
There is no doubt that Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are one of the most important underwater tools in today’s world. However, their proper maneuvering requires extensive training and is restricted by proprietary software.

The ExpROVer software will allow people from a myriad of backgrounds to easily operate the VideoRay Pro 4 (VP4).
* It will be a **free, open-source software**, easy to modify and tailor to your needs
* It will feature **several smart functionalities not present in any other competing software**, like obstacles’ detection and objects’ recognition, and well as several semi-autonomous pre-programmed movements
* It will **support several devices and platforms, such as Linux and Android**, without requiring these devices to be connected to the VP4’s umbilical cord (unlike the VP4’s shipping software, VideoRay Cockpit, which is only executable on a Windows computer directly connected to the VP4)
