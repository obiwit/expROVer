  <p>The ExpROVer project is done with <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> by the Interwater Explorers, under the orientation
    of professors Nuno Lau, Francisco Curado and Paulo Lopes, and under the supervision of professors José Maria
    Fernandes and Rui Aguiar, for PEI, a 3rd year class for the MIECT course of University of Aveiro.</p>

        <p>We were assigned the ROV project, a project which aims to build an infrastructure which connects the VideoRay
          Pro 4 ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) with ROS (Robot Operating System), and will it allow it to be controlled
          from laptops and mobile devices. It also features some AI capabilities, namely Computer Vision technology and
          some semi-anutonomous navigation! We familirized ourselves with the VP4 (VideoRay Pro 4) ROV, and surrounding
          technologies. We also started gathering the initial requirements.</p>

        <p>On the fourth week, we have focused on more thourough requirements gathering and analysis. We did heavy
          progress on the first version of documentation, and agreed on a semi-definitive roles and tasks assignment.
          Finally, we tweaked to website to near deployment-ready status.</p>

        <p>This week, we deployed our website and finished the first milestone's deliverables, after reviewing them with our mentors. We also planned a trip to ECOMARE to build our own dataset for use for the development of the computer vision functionality. Finally we established a timeline for these next two weeks, distributing the tasks for achieving the next (demonstration) milestone in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>João, Gonçalo, António and Tiago decided to try to build software to communicate with the ROV (over the RS-485 serial port) using Python, since it had been decided it would be the language for the Computer Vision functionalities. Tiago was mainly tasked with documenting the progress, major dificulties and architecture of this part of the project. They ran into some problems generating the binary packets in accordance with the VideoRay format, and decided to switch to C, at least for the packets' creation. Sérgio was unexpected delayed with integrating the pdf documentation into the website. Finally, Beatriz continued to work in a Python version of YOLOv3, concluding more images than the already retrieved from several datasets on the internet were needed for desired level of accuracy.</p>

        <p>António switched over to the website, to diminish the impact of the delay. Meanwhile, João, Gonçalo and Tiago managed to achieved communication with the ROV, despite a serious lack of documentation from VideoRay. Meanwhile, Beatriz found a massive 13 thousand label fish images dataset from Google's OpenImages, and promising first results were achieved. However, the classification part of the algorithm still needs some more work. Several possible divisions of the project as MVP/non-MVP were also discussed with the mentors.</p>

        <p>With the integration of the website documentation still lagging behind, Beatriz also switched to full-time work on it. Together with António, they also prepared the presentation for wednesday, and coordinated the communication's demonstration with João and Gonçalo. A final decision on the MVP was done. Overall, we feel we are mostly on schedule, only slightly behing of the wireless part of the architecture pipeline.</p>

        <p>During this week João and Gonçalo managed to correct the input mappings for the joystick which means we can make the ROV move. We are making progress with the camera using the Video Stream OpenCV ROS package that serves as an alternative to the gscam package. Beatriz finalized the CV functionality for now, focusing on guaranteing precision and robustness (only detecting a fish where there truly is a fish, even if some fish are ignored), following professor Francisco's suggestion, who is an expert in the field. António researched ways to implement the communication between C++ and Python, and implemented a first version, using permanent i/o-based communication. He however found out that sockets might prove a better option and is now investigating them.</p>

        <p>João, Gonçalo and Tiago continued their work in the communication with the ROV, and solved the 'camera problem' - clearing up the video feed encoding which was previously distorted, the unknown encoding leaving the colors somewhat haywired.

        <p>With a week away from the 6th and last milestone, we devoted ourselves to finishing the last parts of the projects. Beatriz handled the Android and Web apps, and integrated them with firebase cloud services for synchronization and online storage. The rest of the team focused on the integration between the two systems. One of the bigger problems, which João and Gonçalo managed to solve during this week, was reducing the lag between the ROV camera feed and its reception on a remote device using the internet - which they managed to bring the previously >6 seconds time into ~1 second!</p>
